In the early 21th Century, the factory was repurposed as an all purpose shipping yard, but only after a few years was bought back by the Government and once again used as a hub to produce and ship weapons. The last report from Essex indicated a shipment might have exploded while at the compound. Communications with Essex have ceased after this Cataclysm.",
